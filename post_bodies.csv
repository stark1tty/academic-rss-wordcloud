"<p>Nature Climate Change, Published online: 26 June 2023; <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01713-5"">doi:10.1038/s41558-023-01713-5</a></p>Better adaptation methods are needed in the face of rapid climate change. A pilot process for inclusive adaptation planning reveals that empowering citizens to identify climate impacts, and to discuss interventions to adapt to them, leads to better awareness of and preparedness for future climate change events."
"<p>Nature Climate Change, Published online: 26 June 2023; <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01711-7"">doi:10.1038/s41558-023-01711-7</a></p>Under current land-use regulation, carbon dioxide emissions from biofuel production exceed those from fossil diesel combustion. Therefore, international agreements need to ensure the effective and globally comprehensive protection of natural land before modern bioenergy can effectively contribute to achieving carbon neutrality."
"<p>Nature Climate Change, Published online: 26 June 2023; <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01714-4"">doi:10.1038/s41558-023-01714-4</a></p>Greenland is central to climate research and research now shows that Greenlanders are far more aware of a rapidly changing Arctic climate than of the underlying global causes. However, their willingness to harness new opportunities exceeds fear of climate change’s consequences."
"<p>Nature Climate Change, Published online: 26 June 2023; <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01689-2"">doi:10.1038/s41558-023-01689-2</a></p>Adjusting green public support programmes to green premiums can reduce public spending, yet this is challenged by uncertainty. Underfunding green technologies can delay the green transition, and overfunding them can increase transition costs. Both risks of under- and overfunding can be reduced using responsive adjustments."
"<p>Nature Climate Change, Published online: 26 June 2023; <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01697-2"">doi:10.1038/s41558-023-01697-2</a></p>Bioenergy has been widely viewed as an alternative for fossil fuels and an option for carbon dioxide removal, but there are doubts given the induced land-use changes. This study shows the importance of uniform regulation and comprehensive coverage of carbon-rich areas in reducing total emissions."

Findings based on two nationally representative surveys reveal a large gap between the scientific consensus and Kalaallit views."

Here a pilot study using participatory system mapping finds that the process increases awareness and preparedness for climate risk, and identifies considerations for promoting citizen-led adaptation."

The authors show that temperature enhances nitrous oxide and dinitrogen but varies by soil; temperature sensitivities are similar across soils but are higher for dinitrogen, suggesting complete denitrification in a warmer climate."
